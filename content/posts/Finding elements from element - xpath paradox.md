## Xpath

Xpath is a locator strategy used to find elements on a page. XPath stands for XML path. XPath uses path expressions to select nodes from documents.

## Finding Elements from Element

There are a lot of different approaches for this purpose in different frameworks. [Nightwatch](https://nightwatchjs.org) uses page objects to define elements under a section and Selenium provides methods to look for a target-element inside an element. So let's take an example of a simple page that looks like this.

```html
<div>
 <input/>
 <div id="container">
   <input id="input-username"/>
 </div> 
<div>
```
We need to find the inner input element using XPath. One of the simpler ways would be to use
`//input[id="input-username"]`  but what if the page looks like this.

```html
<div>
 <input/>
 <div id="container">
   <input/>
 </div> 
<div>
```
Selenium has functions like findElement from an element to suit this case.
```js
      // Get element with tag name 'div'
      let element = driver.findElement(By.css("div[id=container]"));

      // Get the element available with tag name 'input' inside element
      let inputElement = await element.findElements(By.css("input"));
```
You will get the inner input element as expected. But what if you decide to use xpath instead of css selector. 

```js
      // Get element with tag name 'div'
      let element = driver.findElement(By.css("div[id=container]"));

      // Get all the elements available on the page with tag name input
      let inputElement = await element.findElements(By.xpath("//input"));
```

It completely disregards your code to start searching for an element under a div element and gives you all the input elements present on the page. Well xpath works differently it has different annotations for searching. In this example we are using `//` which means search anywhere for the element. There is a useful a page that discusses more such xpath expressions:  https://devhints.io/xpath. In this very example we need to use `./` for desired results. 


There is also a [test](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/ec1e4fd77abcfa5be051b121337d54ad73d0d187/java/test/org/openqa/selenium/ChildrenFindingTest.java#L41) in Selenium Repository which shows this is the expected behavior while using xpath:
```js
  @Test
  public void testFindingElementsOnElementByXPathShouldFindTopLevelElements() {
    driver.get(pages.simpleTestPage);
    WebElement parent = driver.findElement(By.id("multiline"));
    List<WebElement> allPs = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//p"));
    List<WebElement> children = parent.findElements(By.xpath("//p"));
    assertThat(allPs.size()).isEqualTo(children.size());
  }
```
