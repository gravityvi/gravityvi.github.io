### Background

I have been learning rust and the concept of strings and how it relates to the ownership concept in Rust is very confusing. I was always confused about passing arguments as reference or string slices in rust. Hope this would help to understand some very basic concepts in Rust.

## Ownership

Rust language has a very specific way of handling garbage collection and that's where ownership comes into the picture.
