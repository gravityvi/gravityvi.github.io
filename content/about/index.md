By profession I am a software developer but beyond that, I have a deep fascination for all things tech ( and thank god for that... I don't think I'd make a very good banker/writer/comedian).

I enjoy solving for problems and making solutions accessible for everyone
Being a part of open source projects, is something that is very important to me and I try and do my part as a developer in the open source team at BrowserStack.

In past I have worked as a backend developer in SenseHawk, helped them develop form service which helps creating customizable forms and generate useful reports on the basis of submissions made to the form. Previous to that I was working for a fintech startup called Acko Insurance. I developed a framework for testing API's using postman test scripts and Django which was then used across various teams in Acko to speed the testing pipeline.

P.s You will find me lifting weights when I am away from keyboard. Oh and researching the wildest animals I can have as pets
