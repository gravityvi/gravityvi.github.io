By profession, I am a software developer but beyond that, I have a deep fascination for all things tech.

I enjoy solving problems and making solutions accessible for everyone
Being a part of open source projects is very important to me and I try and do my part as a developer in the open-source team at BrowserStack.

In past, I have worked as a backend developer in SenseHawk, helped them develop a service that helps to create customizable forms and generate useful reports based on submissions made to the form. Before that, I was working for a fintech startup called Acko Insurance. I developed a framework for testing APIs using postman test scripts and Django which was then used across various teams in Acko to speed the testing pipeline.

P.S You will find me lifting weights when I am away from the keyboard. Oh, and researching the wildest animals I can have as pets.
