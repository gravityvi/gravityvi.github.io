Previous to that I was working for a fintech startup called Acko Insurance. I developed a framework for testing API&rsquo;s using postman test scripts and Django which was then used across various teams in Acko to speed the testing pipeline.</p><p>P.s You will find me lifting weights when I am away from keyboard.
